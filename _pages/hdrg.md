The University of Ottawaâ€™s Computational Analysis and Acceleration Research Group (CARG) specialises in the developing of computational models and algorithms for image/signal processing and machine learning as well as their efficient implementation, with an emphasis on biomedical and autonomous vehicle applications. In this group, we will closely collaborate with our external collaborator National Research Council (NRC), on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-related applications.

This research group evolved from Computer Architecture research group (original CARG). Computer architecture research group was formed in 2008 and focused on the following topics: computer architectures, signal processing architectures, hardware and software accelerators, GPU architectures and programming and algorithmic modifications for more efficient implementation in hardware. In recent years our research has gone in several different directions and therefore we decided to change the name of our group to Computational Analysis and Acceleration Research Group (new CARG).

Current Research Direction: Computer Vision, Signal Processing, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Uncertainty Evaluation, Sensor Fusion, Merging physical and machine learning models, efficient implementation of the models
